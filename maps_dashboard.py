    The 2025 New York City mayoral election is fast approaching with November 4th just over 10 weeks away.  
    The Democratic Primary in June that saw the former New York State Governor, and democratic establishment preference, Andrew Cuomo, faceoff against the self-described Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani.  

    Mamdani won the primary with 44% of the vote, compared to Cuomo‚Äôs 36%, which ignited a media frenzy to explain the victory of a politically recalcitrant socialist over a party veteran with establishment backing.  

    Much of the mainstream media blamed it on Mamdani‚Äôs social media performance and appeal to young voters. Less liberal stations, probably correctly, assumed that it was due to his policy positions.  

    Without a clear answer for correlations among social characteristics and the socialist vote, one common theme among journalists from the right to the left was to question why the ‚Äúblack vote‚Äù skewed so heavily toward Cuomo, despite his representative whiteness and overall affluent affect. Some sources were correct to point out that the ‚Äúblack vote‚Äù is not a monolith and color-based racial identity is far from deterministic of one‚Äôs politics.  

    With this reality in mind, this statistical brief is here to suggest that one of the most influential factors in Mamdani‚Äôs victory over Cuomo was diversity. Primarily racial diversity, though ethnic and cultural diversity as well. The theory to be tested is that geographic racial (as well as ethnic/cultural) homogeneity creates a political ‚Äòenclave‚Äô effect that influences voters to become less friendly to socialist politics, regardless of whether that homogeneity is white, black, Hispanic, Asian or otherwise.  

    Below is a map of New York public housing tracts and electoral districts, along with how those districts voted in the recent democratic mayoral primary, overlayed with a dot-density graph of racial distribution at the block-level provided by the 2020 Decennial Census conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. Dots were placed randomly within each block-level boundary. Each dot represents 40 respondents to the 2020 racial survey. With each block-level geographic subset containing a count of each racial category, each dot was placed by a simulation within that block subset accounting for set of 40 respondents with the same racial and block category.

        To determine the Personal Diversity Index, dots were taken from the Overlay Results map, which placed dots according to the simulation. For the calculation of the personal diversity score, every dot rendered represented one person (rather than 40) and each dot was placed randomly with street level restrictions to simulate the distribution of people in New York City according to their actual geographic distribution of residence. Each dot was then given a personal diversity score that was equal to the number of dots that belonged to a different racial category than the reference dot, divided by the total number of dots within 70 meters of the reference dot. (70 meters as a radius was chosen as that distance is about half the length of an average city block, and roughly the width of most highways that pass through the city). In the example above, the circle pictured has a roughly 70-meter radius with the reference dot at the center. Within 70 meters of the reference dot there are 15 total dots, where 10 of those dots are of a different racial category. Since there are 15 dots total, with 10 dots of a different racial category, the Personal Diversity Index for the reference dot = 10/15 = 0.75. In the image above, each dot is equal to roughly 40 people. To determine the Personal Diversity Index of each distinct election district in New York City, every dot representing one respondent to the racial survey included in the 2020 Decennial Census of Population and Housing, was placed by the simulation and then assigned a Personal Diversity Index determined by their 70-meter radius environment. For each election district, these Personal Diversity Indices were then summed and divided by the total number of respondents placed by the simulation within each election district.

    One of the principal challenges in estimating such effects is the issue of aggregation and the ecological fallacy that arises from the chosen aggregation method for geographically correlated parameters.  

    In order to derive the most accurate measurements at the election district level, each individual from the initial racial distribution simulation was assigned a census tract FIPS code according to where their dot was placed and the unique census tract they were contained in. Then all of the parameters belonging to the individuals with the same NYC election district code were summed and divided by the number of individuals within that district to find the average values of each parameter within each election district.

      <b>In Public Housing</b> ‚Äì Similar to Personal Diversity Score, the proportion of each election district living in public housing was estimated by totaling the number of dots, placed individually using the simulation which utilized the block-level data provided by the 2020 Decennial Census.
      A map of New York City‚Äôs public housing districts was then overlayed and the number of dots within each overlay subset were counted.

      <b>2024 Arrests Per Cap</b> ‚Äì This is a census-level variable.
      In each census district the total number of arrests were summed and then divided by the number of people recorded by the census to live in that district.
      Since every dot placed by the simulation of population by race provided by the 2020 U.S. Decennial Census had a unique census tract FIPS code, this average was attributed to every ‚Äúdot‚Äù (person) that fell within a particular census tract.
      Each of those individuals additionally had a unique election district code.
      For each election district, all characteristics of every dot were then summed and divided by the number of dots within that election district; those averages, such as 2024 arrests per cap, were then assigned to that election district.

      <b>Average Median Income</b> ‚Äì This is a census-level variable.
      Median income per census tract was assigned to each dot placed by the simulation with the matching unique census tract FIPS code.
      These median incomes per dot were then summed and divided according to the group of dots with the same election district code.
      The average was then assigned to that election district.

    Since the personal diversity score and the Shannon diversity index track with a correlation coefficient of 0.96, the models below utilize the personal diversity score as the primary independent variable for diversity since its proportionality between 0 and 1 makes its effects on vote proportions easier to interpret and because it stands to reason that the personal diversity score may be a better measure of ‚Äòfelt‚Äô diversity than the Shannon diversity index. This is because the Shannon diversity index is calculated with probability at the election district level, whereas the personal diversity score is calculated for each person at the individual level.  

    To estimate the effects of diversity on the election outcome in the New York Democratic Mayoral Primary, several 'full' models that regress the variables average personal diversity score within the election district, average census tract level percent of individuals that are multi lingual, average census tract level percent of individuals that are non-native, census tract level average median income, average census tract level number of arrests per capita, the proportion of individuals in the election district that live in public housing and finally the turnout per election district on the proportion of the democratic primary vote in each election district that was awarded to Zohran Mamdani are estimated.  

    The partial version then models the proportion of the vote that went to Zohran Mamdani per election district as a function of only the average personal diversity score of the election district, the proportion of individuals in the election district living in public housing and the turnout per election district. These are the distinctly election-district level variables. 

    The final bivariate model regresses only the average personal diversity score per election district on the proportion of the vote that went to Zohran Mamdani within that election district.  

    Below are two distinct models. First, a standard logit model with three parameter specifications, full, partial and bivariate that each utilize the proportion of the vote that went to Zohran Mamdani per election distrcit as the dependant variable. Then second, a multinomial logit model with a full specification that uses each each election district's liklihood of choosing each Democratic Mayoral Primary candidate over Cuomo (as the baseline) as the dependant variable. The first specification of the multinomial logit model gives each election district equal weight regardless of the number of voters. The second specification incorporates weights for the number of people that voted in each election district in the estimation of the parameter's coefficients.

    This means that as the vote size of an election district increases, the model becomes significantly better at predicting the outcome. Along with the increased significance of the parameter coefficients over the unweighted model, this is strong evidence that the average personal diversity score, turnout, percent multi-lingual, and percent non-native are important determinants of a given election district‚Äôs likelihood to elect Zohran Mamdani.  

    Insofar as votes for Zohran Mamdani represent votes for socialist political sentiment, this should be considered strong evidence that the racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity of one‚Äôs community affects their likelihood of having sympathy for socialist politics.  

    Taken inversely, the findings provide reason to believe that racial, ethnic, and cultural homogeneity within a geographic community affect that communities liklihood to be adverse to socialist politics.

In an area that tends to be very diverse, where almost every district voted overwhelmingly for Zohran Mamdani, the four areas that voted decidedly for Cuomo were areas with a majority of their population living within New York City public housing districts. 
This is a trend that has been mirrored across the city and has been additionally captured by the negative sign on the In Public Housing coefficient estimated by all five of the models above. What this means in terms of political strategy for Zohran Mamdani‚Äôs campaign, is that he should focus much of his effort within public housing districts for the remaining ten weeks before the election. Not only would this be an effective strategy given the sympathy of diverse electorates, but it would also have the potential to further galvanize the movement by speaking to voters that stand to gain the most from socialist policies.
